# OntologiesProject
The countries ontology is designed to represent information about countries, cities, landmarks, rulers, government types, immigrants, and surrounding waters. The ontology defines various object properties such as "hasCity," "hasGovernmentType," "hasImmigrants," "hasLandmark," "hasNativeResidents," "hasRuler," "isCapitalOf," "isInContinent," and "isSurroundedBy" to establish relationships between entities. It also includes data properties like "address," "hasYearBuilt," "rulertype," and "watertype" to capture specific information about landmarks, rulers, and surrounding waters. The ontology further defines classes such as "Capital," "City," "Continent," "Country," "GovernmentType," "Immigrant," "Landmark," "Native," "Person," and "Ruler" to classify different types of entities. By utilizing this ontology, you can organize and query data related to countries, their attributes, and relationships in a structured and semantic manner.
